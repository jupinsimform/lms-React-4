# User list app - UI

## Practical-4

- Create a dummy project named “user-list-react-app” in react using any of the above methods - CRA or webpack from scratch.
- The card on the right is the card that will appear on hovering over a user. This card will be containing details of the user which we hovered over.
- Use static dummy data for the user list for now.
- The user in the first row should have “Active” as status and “owner” as access in the list always, with a lock sign icon instead of a dust bin icon.
